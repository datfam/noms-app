# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 14, 2026**

Welcome to **NOMS**. Your privacy is our priority. This policy outlines how we handle your data within the NOMS application.

### 1. Data Collection & Usage
NOMS is designed as a privacy-first application. Most of your data is stored locally on your device.
- **Photos & Stickers:** When you use our "Remove Background" feature, the image processing happens entirely on your device using Apple's local APIs. We do not upload or store your photos on external servers.
- **Location Data:** If you grant location permissions, geo-tags are saved locally to your food entries to help you remember where you ate. This data is never shared with us or any third parties.
- **Financial Data:** Your spending records and budget settings are kept private on your device and synced only via your personal iCloud account.

### 2. Permissions
To provide a complete experience, NOMS requests access to:
- **Camera:** To capture food photos directly.
- **Photo Library:** To select existing photos for your journal and save generated stickers.
- **Location:** To add location context to your food diary.

### 3. Third-Party Services
We use standard Apple services:
- **iCloud:** For secure data synchronization across your devices.
- **App Store:** For processing NOMS PRO subscriptions.
These services are governed by Apple's own Privacy Policy.
